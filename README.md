“Hyper-local air quality prediction with IDW &amp; PM2.5 forecasting”
 Breath Analyzer – Hyper-Local Air Quality Predictor

A predictive air-quality engine using **Spatial Interpolation (IDW)**, **PM2.5 forecasting**, **dynamic heatmaps**, and **automated alerts**.  
Built for **Eco-Hackathon – Round 2 Prototype Submission**.

 1. Project Overview

City-wide air quality averages hide the real pollution differences between specific traffic junctions and clean areas.  
This project solves the **data blindspot** by estimating AQI at any location and predicting upcoming pollution levels.

The system includes:
- Blind-spot AQI estimation (IDW interpolation)
- PM2.5 12–24 hour prediction (ML-ready)
- Red Zones (hazardous) and Green Corridors (safe)
- Interactive map with user location marker
- Automatic alerts when entering a polluted area

This prototype demonstrates core logic for proof-of-concept.

6. How the Prototype Works

 Interpolation (IDW)
Estimates pollution at locations where no sensor exists by giving more weight to nearby stations.

 Prediction (ML Model – optional)
Predicts PM2.5 for the next 12–24 hours using weather + historical data  
(Custom model can be added in `app.py` later.)

 Visualization
- Red zone → hazardous area  
- Green zone → safe corridor  
- Click on map → moves user marker  
- If marker enters red zone → automatic alert appears
